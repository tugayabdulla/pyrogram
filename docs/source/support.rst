Support Pyrogram
================

As a developer, you probably understand that "open source" doesn't mean "free work". If you wish to tip me for Pyrogram
-- or any of my `other works`_ -- you can do so by the ways shown below. Your appreciation means a lot and helps
staying motivated!

found it to be useful, give Pyrogram a `Star on GitHub`_.
